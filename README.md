OUTDATED - NOT MAINTAINED - (I think cinnamon now suports more panels)

morePanels
==========

A Cinnamon-Extension that allows you to have more than 2 panels in multi-monitor setups.

I did lots of monkey-patching because the two Panels are hardcoded(!) in Cinnamon...
So don't blame with me when something went wrong ;-)

For different Window-Lists on different Monitors (up to two at the moment) use the window-list-multi-monitor@mazz applet.
